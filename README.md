This is one of my biggest project
It's a Transport Management System projct which may apply in a real world scenario like a Sacco eg Super metro
The Transport Management System (TMS) is designed to efficiently manage transportation operations.
  It includes features for handling vehicles, drivers, routes, passengers, and trips, ensuring smooth management and coordination
  
Below are the features:

  1:Vehicle Management: Maintain information about vehicle make, model, year, and assigned driver.

  2:Driver Management: Record driver details such as name and license number, and link them to vehicles.

  3:Route Management: Define routes with start and end locations, distance, and estimated duration.

  4:Passenger Management: Store passenger information and manage their association with trips.

  5:Trip Scheduling: Link vehicles, drivers, routes, and passengers to create scheduled trips.
